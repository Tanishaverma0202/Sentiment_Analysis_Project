# Employee Feedback Sentiment Analysis

## Project Summary

This project analyzes employee feedback emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment, score employees, identify top positive/negative performers, detect flight risks, and build predictive models for sentiment trends.

### Key Results

#### Top Employees by Sentiment
- **Top 3 Positive Employees:**
  - Kayne Coulter
  - Patti Thompson
  - Don Baughman

- **Top 3 Negative Employees:**
  - Rhonda Denton
  - Johnny Palmer

#### Flight Risk Identification
- Employees flagged as potential **flight risks** (≥4 negative emails within 30 rolling days):
  - Bobette Ringer
  - Johnny Palmer
  - Lydia Delgado
  - Patti Thompson
  - Rhona Denton
  - Sally Beck

#### Key Insights & Recommendations

- Positive employees contribute to morale and team spirit; they should be recognized and retained.
- Negative employees require deeper engagement – potential issues could be workload, leadership, or organizational culture.
- Flight risk employees should be **monitored closely**, with HR interventions to address their concerns before attrition risk increases.
- Predictive modeling demonstrates that sentiment trends are influenced by email frequency and length, which can be used as early warning indicators.
