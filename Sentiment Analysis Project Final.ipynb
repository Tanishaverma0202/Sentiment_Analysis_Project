        "2. **Trend over time**: reveals periods of elevated negativity/positivity which could indicate events (policy changes, layoffs, product launches).\n",
        "3. **Feedback length vs sentiment**: helps detect behavioral patterns (e.g., negative messages are longer — indicates ranting; positive are short — quick praise).\n",
        "4. **Top negative contributor**: helps identify employees who may be repeatedly expressing negative sentiment."

        "*   **Sentiment Thresholds:** The initial sentiment thresholds (0.2 for positive, -0.2 for negative) were reviewed and retained based on the distribution of the calculated sentiment scores. Comments were added to the code emphasizing the need for validation with domain-specific, human-labeled data.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Multiple Sentiment Tools:** The project correctly utilizes both TextBlob and VADER for sentiment analysis. Comments were added to the code to explicitly justify this approach as a way to reduce single-model bias and acknowledge the importance of domain specificity. The code execution revealed instances of significant score differences between the tools, reinforcing the value of using multiple methods.\n",
        "*   **Employee Score Rationale:** The calculation of the \"Employee\\_Score\" metric was clarified with comments. The formula assigns a 60% weight to average sentiment (positivity), 20% to sentiment consistency (inverse of standard deviation), and 20% to engagement (normalized feedback count). This weighting scheme aims to provide a balanced view of employee sentiment and participation.\n",
        "*   **AI Limitations and Bias:** A new markdown cell was added to the notebook discussing the inherent limitations of AI in sentiment analysis, such as difficulty with context, sarcasm, and domain jargon, and the potential for bias. It highlights the critical need for human oversight and domain expertise to interpret results accurately.\n",
        "*   **Predictive Modeling Features:** Comments were added to the predictive modeling code explaining the rationale for using message length, word count, and messages per month as features (longer/more frequent messages might indicate more detailed or consistent sentiment).\n",
        "*   **Predictive Model Interpretation:** A comment was added to the predictive modeling output explaining that the R-squared value indicates the proportion of variance in the sentiment score explained by the chosen features. A low R-squared suggests these simple features are not strong predictors on their own.\n"
